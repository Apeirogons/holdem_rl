Improvement of RLCard holdem env, fast neural network approximation of expected hand strength

rlcard/envs/nolimitholdem and rlcard/games/nolimitholdem are modified to have a better one-hot encoding of board, expected hand strength, pot size, and more.

However, the learned strategy after a night of training is still pretty bad.
